# Agent Bricks CLI command reference

`agentbricks` is the Agent Bricks command-line interface for building and deploying custom AI agents on Databricks. It
scaffolds an agent project from a template, runs it locally with a chat UI, deploys it to Databricks
Apps, and manages the tools, memory, sessions, and tracing behind it - all from one authenticated
command.

This page is the full command reference: every command, subcommand, argument, and option. For
concepts, guides, and the Python SDK, see the [README](README.md). Every command also has built-in
help - append `--help` (or `-h`) at any level, for example `agentbricks deploy --help` or
`agentbricks sessions items append --help`.

> **Preview:** Agent Bricks CLI is experimental. The CLI, its commands, and the underlying agent APIs are all in
> preview, may need to be enabled for your workspace, and are likely to change in
> backward-incompatible ways.

## Installation

```sh
pip install databricks-agentbricks
```

The `databricks-agentbricks` distribution provides the `agentbricks` command and AgentKit SDK.

See [Installation](README.md#installation) for installing from source and for shell completion.

## Authentication

Agent Bricks CLI authenticates with a [Databricks configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication).
Run `agentbricks login` once to save a default profile, or pass `--profile` / `-p` on any command. Without
a profile, the Databricks SDK's default authentication resolution is used. See
[Authentication](README.md#authentication) for details.

## Global options

These options apply to every command. Pass them before the command name, for example
`agentbricks -p my-profile -o json sessions stores list`.

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--profile <PROFILE>` (`-p`) | string | - | `~/.databrickscfg` profile to authenticate with. |
| `--output <text\|json>` (`-o`) | `text` \| `json` | `text` | Output format. Use `json` for scripting. |
| `--version` | flag | - | Show the version and exit. |
| `--help` (`-h`) | flag | - | Show help for the command and exit. Works at every level. |

## How to read this reference

- **Arguments** are positional; **options** are named flags. In a synopsis, `NAME` is required and
  `[NAME]` is optional; `<command>` marks a group that requires a subcommand; `[options]` stands in
  for the option list documented below each command.
- The **Required** column marks whether an argument or option must be provided.
- The **Default** column shows the value used when an option is omitted (`-` means none).
- Commands that delete or replace data prompt for confirmation; pass `--yes` / `-y` to skip the
  prompt in scripts.

## Commands

### `agentbricks login`

Authenticate a profile and save it as the default, so later commands can omit -p.

```
agentbricks login [options]
```


_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--profile <PROFILE>` (`-p`) | string | - | no | Profile to authenticate with and remember as the default. |

### `agentbricks logout`

Forget the saved profile selection without deleting its credentials.

```
agentbricks logout
```

### `agentbricks init`

Scaffold a local agent project from an Agent Bricks CLI template.

DIRECTORY is the target path to create (defaults to the template's own name). The directory must not already exist. Once scaffolded, deploy it with `agentbricks deploy <name> --source <directory>`.

Pass --profile (or set a default via `agentbricks login` / -p) to seed a local `.env` so the scaffolded project runs with `agentbricks dev` right away.

The scaffold is preconfigured to call Databricks model serving through the AI Gateway using that profile, so it can talk to a model with no separate endpoint or API key to set up.

`--server agentbricks` selects the managed server, which supports foreground, streaming, and background invocations through one HTTP contract and Runtime Store. This existing server value is recorded in `agent.toml`. Pass `--server custom` for a minimal foreground-only FastAPI server.

```
agentbricks init [DIRECTORY] [options]
```


_Arguments_

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIRECTORY` | no | - |

_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--framework <langgraph|openai>` | `langgraph` \| `openai` | - | no | Agent framework to scaffold (defaults to langgraph). |
| `--server <agentbricks|custom>` | `agentbricks` \| `custom` | `agentbricks` | no | Use the managed invocation server (`agentbricks` is the existing `agent.toml` value) or a minimal custom FastAPI server. |
| `--profile <PROFILE>` | string | - | no | Seed a local .env with this DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE so `agentbricks dev` works immediately (defaults to the profile from -p / `agentbricks login`). |
| `--disable-chat-app` | flag | - | no | Scaffold the API-only backend, without the browser chat app. |
| `--enable-chat-app` | flag | - | no | Deprecated: the chat app is included by default; this flag is a no-op. |
| `--memory-store <MEMORY_STORE>` | string | - | no | Name for the declared memory store (default: derived from the directory, <dir>-memory). Only --server agentbricks declares stores by default. |
| `--session-store <SESSION_STORE>` | string | - | no | Name for the declared session store (default: derived from the directory, <dir>-session). |
| `--existing` | flag | - | no | Prepare a coding-agent migration bundle for an existing LangGraph or OpenAI Agents SDK project (defaults to `.`). Requires `--server agentbricks`. |

### `agentbricks doctor`

Check whether an existing agent repository is onboarded to Agent Bricks. DIRECTORY defaults to the
current directory.

Doctor is read-only and offline: it does not import application source, contact Databricks, or
change files. It checks `agent.toml`, `.agentbricks/project.toml`, the framework-specific
`databricks-agentbricks` dependency extra, `app.yaml`, and production Python source for a
`DurableAgentServer` instance with an `invoke` hook plus a recognized framework adapter call; test,
example, and old/stale directories are excluded. A bounded source scan that exceeds a limit is
reported while the evidence it already found still counts. These checks are static repository
evidence, not proof that the configured startup command executes the files found. Doctor exits 0
only when every check passes, and exits 1 after printing a normal report otherwise. If the framework
is unknown, the remediation requires an explicit `--framework <framework_name>`. Use global
`-o json` for a structured report.

```
agentbricks doctor [DIRECTORY]
```

_Arguments_

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DIRECTORY` | no | Existing agent repository to inspect (default: `.`). |

### `agentbricks dev`

Run your agent locally so you can try it before deploying.

Starts the agent on a local server - by default http://localhost:8000 - and prints where to reach it: the chat UI if the project has one, otherwise a sample request against the agent's API.

Auth uses your Databricks profile (`-p` / `agentbricks login`), and the agent reaches Databricks model serving through the AI Gateway on that profile - so there are no model keys to set up.

Under the hood this wraps `databricks apps run-local`: it reads the command + env from `app.yaml` and runs the app the way the Apps runtime would, so local behavior matches a deployment. The environment is built on the first run and reused after; pass `--prepare-environment` to force a rebuild (e.g. after changing dependencies).

Everything runs locally: `agentbricks dev` is a local deployment that does not depend on a Databricks workspace for its resources. Tracing goes to a local MLflow tracking server (sqlite-backed, under the existing `.agentbricks/` state directory) so traces are recorded on your machine with no workspace experiment or setup - open the printed Traces URL to view them (`agentbricks tracing unbind` doesn't affect dev; it only stops the deployed agent's tracing). Long-term memory is off and conversation history is in-process (not durable): the memory/session stores bound with `agentbricks memory/sessions bind` are created and used only when you `agentbricks deploy`, not here. So there's nothing to provision and no service-principal grant to make; that all happens at `agentbricks deploy` time.

```
agentbricks dev [options]
```


_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Local source directory to run (containing app.yaml). Defaults to the current directory. |
| `--prepare-environment`, `--no-prepare-environment` | flag | - | no | Build the app's environment with uv before running. Default: build only if no .venv exists yet, and reuse it otherwise. Requires uv. |
| `--app-port <APP_PORT>` | integer | - | no | Port to run the app on (default 8000). |

### `agentbricks memory`

Manage an agent's long-term memory: memory stores and their entries.

Memory is what an agent remembers across separate conversations - durable facts and preferences (for example "prefers concise answers", or a saved profile detail), as opposed to the turn-by-turn history of a single conversation (that is `agentbricks sessions`).

A memory store is the managed store that holds this memory; each entry is a small document (a path plus its content) partitioned by actor, so one store keeps every user's memories separate.

### `agentbricks sessions`

Manage an agent's conversations: session stores, the sessions in them, and their items.

A session is a single conversation between an actor (a user) and the agent. It holds that conversation's ordered transcript of items - the messages, tool calls, and results that make up its running state. A session store is the managed store that holds an agent's sessions and their items, giving it durable conversation history it can list, resume, fork, or delete.

This is the short-term, per-conversation counterpart to the cross-conversation memory in `agentbricks memory`.

```
agentbricks sessions items pop [options]
```


_Options_

#### `agentbricks sessions bind`

Bind session STORE to the agent by declaring it in agent.toml.

This only edits agent.toml - it does not create the store. `agentbricks deploy` creates any declared store that doesn't exist yet and grants the deployed app's service principal access to it.

### `agentbricks tracing`

Configure MLflow tracing for your deployed agents, and inspect the traces.

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`tracing bind`](#agentbricks-tracing-bind) | Bind tracing to an experiment, by name or id (one required). |
| [`tracing unbind`](#agentbricks-tracing-unbind) | Unbind tracing (remove the binding), turning tracing off for the deployed agent (deploy-only; `agentbricks dev` still traces locally). |
| [`tracing list`](#agentbricks-tracing-list) | List recent agent traces in an experiment. |
| [`tracing get`](#agentbricks-tracing-get) | Get a single trace by id (status, latency, span count, previews). |

#### `agentbricks tracing bind`

Bind tracing to an experiment, by name or id. Requires one of them (like `agentbricks memory/sessions bind`); the binding's presence is what turns tracing on.

The experiment is stored as a NAME, not an id, so the binding stays valid across workspaces/profiles - Agent Bricks CLI creates or reuses it in the active workspace at deploy. ``--experiment-id`` (e.g. from the experiment's URL) is a convenience: it's resolved to the experiment's name and stored as a name, never as an id.

```
agentbricks tracing bind [options]
```


_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--experiment-name <EXPERIMENT_NAME>` | string | - | no | MLflow experiment name to trace to - an absolute workspace path, e.g. /Shared/agentbricks_traces/&lt;agent&gt; or /Users/&lt;you&gt;/agentbricks_traces/&lt;agent&gt;. Agent Bricks CLI creates or reuses it at deploy. Mutually exclusive with --experiment-id. |
| `--experiment-id <EXPERIMENT_ID>` | string | - | no | MLflow experiment id (e.g. copied from the experiment's workspace URL) to trace to. Resolved to the experiment's name and stored as a name - Agent Bricks CLI stores names, not ids, so the binding stays valid across workspaces. Mutually exclusive with --experiment-name. |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Project directory containing agent.toml. Defaults to the current directory. |

#### `agentbricks tracing unbind`

Unbind tracing: remove the experiment binding from agent.toml, turning tracing off for the DEPLOYED agent (`agentbricks deploy` then wires no MLflow env).

Deploy-only: `agentbricks dev` still traces locally to its own MLflow server, so you keep local traces while the deployed agent stays untraced.

```
agentbricks tracing unbind [options]
```


_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Project directory containing agent.toml. Defaults to the current directory. |

#### `agentbricks tracing list`

List recent agent traces in an experiment.

An explicit ``--experiment-name`` / ``--experiment-id`` reads that workspace experiment and must name one that exists (errors otherwise, so a typo isn't mistaken for an empty experiment). With neither, this project's experiment is read: the workspace one if it's been provisioned (by `agentbricks deploy`), otherwise the local `agentbricks dev` store (`.agentbricks/mlflow.db`), so a not-yet-deployed dev run's traces still show up here (tagged "(local dev)"). Nothing traced anywhere yet lists nothing. A UC-backed experiment is read through a SQL warehouse (``--warehouse``).

```
agentbricks tracing list [options]
```


_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--experiment-name <EXPERIMENT_NAME>` | string | - | no | MLflow experiment name to read (an absolute workspace path). Default: this project's experiment. |
| `--experiment-id <EXPERIMENT_ID>` | string | - | no | MLflow experiment id to read (e.g. from the experiment URL). Mutually exclusive with --experiment-name. |
| `--warehouse <WAREHOUSE_ID>` | string | - | no | SQL warehouse id used to read traces from a UC-backed experiment (required for UC experiments; ignored for managed). Falls back to the MLFLOW_TRACING_SQL_WAREHOUSE_ID env var. |
| `--limit <LIMIT>` | integer | `20` | no | - |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Project directory to resolve the default experiment from (default: current dir). |

#### `agentbricks tracing get`

Get a single trace by id (status, latency, span count, previews).

Reads from the same place as `agentbricks tracing list`: an explicit ``--experiment-name`` / ``--experiment-id`` targets that workspace store and must name one that exists (errors otherwise); otherwise this project's workspace experiment if provisioned, else its local `agentbricks dev` store. A UC-backed experiment is read through a SQL warehouse (``--warehouse``).

```
agentbricks tracing get TRACE_ID [options]
```


_Arguments_

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TRACE_ID` | yes | - |

_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--experiment-name <EXPERIMENT_NAME>` | string | - | no | MLflow experiment name to read (an absolute workspace path). Default: this project's experiment. |
| `--experiment-id <EXPERIMENT_ID>` | string | - | no | MLflow experiment id to read (e.g. from the experiment URL). Mutually exclusive with --experiment-name. |
| `--warehouse <WAREHOUSE_ID>` | string | - | no | SQL warehouse id used to read traces from a UC-backed experiment (required for UC experiments; ignored for managed). Falls back to the MLFLOW_TRACING_SQL_WAREHOUSE_ID env var. |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Project directory to resolve the experiment from (default: current dir). |

### `agentbricks deploy`

Deploy your agent to Databricks Apps and get back a hosted URL to try it.

Rolls the agent out to Databricks Apps and prints the URL where you (or anyone you share it with) can use it. The deployed agent reaches Databricks model serving through the AI Gateway using the app's own identity - no model keys to configure - and `deploy` also reconciles the stores declared in agent.toml and wires in any tracing.

NAME is recorded in agent.toml on the first deploy, so a later `agentbricks deploy` from the project directory can omit it (passing NAME again updates the recorded name). Deployed apps are named `agent-bricks-<name>`. A project with a recorded base name reuses that app when NAME is omitted; you can also pass the full app name to update it. Use the full app name with the `agentbricks deployments` commands.

Any memory/session store declared in agent.toml (for example, by `agentbricks memory/sessions bind`) is created if it doesn't exist yet; agent.toml itself is never modified for stores.

Scaling to multiple instances (--instances) uses best-effort sticky routing, so a browser session automatically stays on one instance.

To keep a session on one app replica (sticky routing), API clients must resend a stable UUID (for example, their session id) in the `X-Routing-Key` request header on every request. The header is a routing hint only - non-blank, no more than 128 UTF-8 bytes, used verbatim - not authentication and not the session id itself (send the session id in the request body). Example: `X-Routing-Key: <uuid>`

```
agentbricks deploy [NAME] [options]
```


_Arguments_

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NAME` | no | - |

_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Local source directory for the deployment (containing app.yaml). Defaults to the current directory. |
| `--pip-index-url <PIP_INDEX_URL>` | string | `https://pypi.org/simple/` | no | Base URL of the Python Package Index. Defaults to public PyPI. |
| `--workspace-path <WORKSPACE_PATH>` | string | - | no | Workspace destination for the synced source (defaults to a per-user path). |
| `--instances <INSTANCES>` | integer range | - | no | Number of deployment instances. |
| `--allow-user-scope-update` | flag | - | no | Allow Agent Bricks to add missing user API scopes to an existing App from managed-tool inference and `[auth.user]` additions. Once added, later deploys do not need this flag. |

### `agentbricks tools`

Discover available integrations and manage an agent's tool bindings.

Tools are what let an agent act beyond the language model itself - query governed data, call a service, or run a function - and each one is recorded in agent.toml so `agentbricks dev` / `agentbricks deploy` wire it in. `agentbricks tools add` manages these Databricks-managed tool types:

sandbox Query Unity Catalog data via system.ai.sandbox, scoped to the tables, volumes, or paths you choose. mcp A Databricks-managed MCP service (see `agentbricks tools list --kind mcp`), e.g. system.ai.web_search. uc-function An existing Unity Catalog function (catalog.schema.function). genie-one Workspace-wide Genie One MCP tools. genie-agent Native Genie conversation tools for a configured space ID.

Browse available integrations with `agentbricks tools list`, add one with `agentbricks tools add <type>`, and drop a binding with `agentbricks tools remove`. Review agent.toml for configured managed tools and MCP bindings. The list shows addable integrations, not configured bindings or individual operations inside an MCP service. Custom Python tools are code-first - write them directly in your project's code rather than through the CLI.

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`tools add`](#agentbricks-tools-add) | Add a managed sandbox, MCP service, UC function, or Genie tool binding. |
| [`tools list`](#agentbricks-tools-list) | List available integrations to add, not configured agent bindings. |
| [`tools remove`](#agentbricks-tools-remove) | Remove a managed tool binding from this agent. |

#### `agentbricks tools add`

Add a managed sandbox, MCP service, UC function, or Genie tool binding.

Subcommands target the current directory by default.

Pass --source PATH to target another project.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--scope <SCOPES>` | string | - | yes | Allowed table:, volume:, or workspace: resource. Repeat for multiple scopes. |
| `--permission <read_only|read_write>` | `read_only` \| `read_write` | `read_only` | no | - |
| `--name <TOOL_ID>` | string | `sandbox` | no | - |
| `--auth <user|app>` | `user` \| `app` | `user` | no | - |

| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Agent project containing agent.toml. |

##### `agentbricks tools add mcp`

Validate and add a Databricks-managed MCP service as a tool.

Use `agentbricks tools list --kind mcp` for available services. Review the target project's agent.toml to check configured managed tools and MCP bindings.

```
agentbricks tools add mcp SERVICE [options]
```


_Arguments_

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SERVICE` | yes | - |

_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |

| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Agent project containing agent.toml. |

##### `agentbricks tools add genie-one`

Add workspace-wide Genie One MCP tools.

```
agentbricks tools add genie-one [options]
```


_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--name <TOOL_ID>` | string | `genie_one` | no | - |
| `--auth <user|app>` | `user` \| `app` | `user` | no | - |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Agent project containing agent.toml. |

##### `agentbricks tools add genie-agent`

_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `--auth <user|app>` | `user` \| `app` | `user` | no | - |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Agent project containing agent.toml. |

#### `agentbricks tools list`

List available integrations to add, not configured agent bindings.

By default, show built-in add recipes plus caller-visible MCP Services in system.ai. `--kind mcp` limits discovery to MCP Services; `--schema catalog.schema` replaces system.ai. Sandbox recipes require scopes; UC-function and Genie Agent recipes require concrete resource identifiers. Genie One needs no additional argument.

No agent project is required. MCP discovery uses your Databricks profile; local recipes do not authenticate. This does not scan every workspace schema or list individual MCP operations. API failures return a nonzero exit status and mark discovery incomplete, not empty.

Review agent.toml to check configured managed tools and MCP bindings. The former configured list and `--source` option are removed. JSON discovery uses schema_version 2 and available_tools.

```
agentbricks tools list [options]
```


_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--kind <sandbox|mcp|uc-function|genie-one|genie-agent>` | choice | - | no | Show one integration kind. Sandbox, uc-function, genie-one, and genie-agent show local add recipes only. |
| `--schema <SCHEMA>` | string | - | no | Two-part UC schema: catalog.schema (default: system.ai). Requires --kind mcp. |

#### `agentbricks tools remove`

Remove a managed tool binding from this agent.

```
agentbricks tools remove TOOL_ID [MCP_SERVICE] [options]
```


_Arguments_

| Argument | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TOOL_ID` | yes | - |
| `MCP_SERVICE` | no | - |

_Options_

| Option | Values | Default | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--source <SOURCE>` | path | `.` | no | Agent project containing agent.toml. |

## `agentbricks status`

Show project bindings and resources; configuration alone is not verified readiness.

```sh
agentbricks --profile <profile> status [--source DIRECTORY] [--verify]
agentbricks --profile <profile> --output json status --verify
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--source DIRECTORY` | `.` | Project directory containing `agent.toml`. |
| `--verify` | off | Check resource availability using read-only workspace APIs. Requires a selected profile. |

Without `--verify`, status reads only local configuration and provisioning receipts. It does not
initialize authentication, refresh tokens, create stores, or write project files. The workspace host
comes from the selected profile; no profile means an unresolved workspace. With `--verify`, status
uses the selected profile's actual workspace and reports resource identifiers, URLs when available,
App state, missing resources and individual check errors without losing successful results.
`accessible` means the caller can read the resource; it does not promise the deployed App can use
it, or that model/tool invocation has succeeded. Tool bindings remain unverified. JSON contains a
versioned inventory with per-resource ownership, verification, error and next action.

## `agentbricks cleanup`

Preview cleanup of project-created deployments; retain shared stores, traces and tools.

```sh
agentbricks --profile <profile> cleanup [--source DIRECTORY]
agentbricks --profile <profile> cleanup --apply [--yes] [--source DIRECTORY]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--source DIRECTORY` | `.` | Project directory containing `agent.toml`. |
| `--apply` | off | Apply the previewed cleanup; default is preview only. |
| `--yes` (`-y`) | off | Skip the confirmation prompt. Requires `--apply`. |

A selected profile scopes both preview and apply to one workspace. The default preview uses only
local files. Apply resolves the actual workspace, displays its exact targets, then asks for
confirmation. `--output json` provides the final per-resource plan/results on stdout; the apply
preview is written to stderr. Failed resources cause exit status 1 and can be retried.

Deploy writes workspace-scoped creation/reuse receipts to `.agentbricks/resources.json`, including
resources created before a later deploy step fails. Keep this local file to enable safe cleanup.
Only a project-created App whose current service-principal identity still matches its receipt can
be removed. Its managed Runtime Store is removed first, after verifying its app owner; failure
retains the App. Successful deletes and partial failures are persisted after each resource.

Existing/adopted Apps and resources with no receipt are retained. Shared-capable memory/session
stores, experiments, tools, workspace source folders, legacy Lakebase projects and local files are
always retained, even when this project created them. Current APIs cannot prove exclusive use.
If the App is already missing, any residual Runtime Store is retained for manual owner inspection.
Cleanup does not unbind resources or erase source/evaluation history.

## Starter evaluations

The OpenAI and LangGraph Agent Bricks server templates include `evals/cases.jsonl`, `evals/run.py`
and extension instructions. Start the actual project agent with `agentbricks dev`, then run:

```sh
uv run python evals/run.py
uv run python evals/run.py --app <deployment> --profile <oauth-profile>
```

The runner calls `/api/invocations`, uses fresh sessions, preserves the project model/tools, and
records case inputs, final answers, errors, scorer feedback and aggregate results in MLflow.
The default tracking URI is `sqlite:///.agentbricks/evaluations.db`. See the scaffold's
`evals/README.md` for all options, results UI and workspace tracking. A failed invocation or
expectation exits nonzero. Custom HTTP server templates require their own evaluator contract.
