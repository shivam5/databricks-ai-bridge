# Managed runtime integration contract for LangGraph

This document owns the requirements shared by generated projects and existing agents adopting
the managed runtime. The [README](README.md) owns commands and HTTP examples; adapter docstrings own API details.
The adjacent template is an example, not a required graph architecture. Runtime internals live in
the installed package's runtime guide.

## Command requirements

Agent Bricks CLI commands operate on an application directory; they do not rewrite its graph. Each capability
needs runtime wiring as well as manifest configuration.

| Command | Required integration |
| --- | --- |
| `dev`, `deploy` | Installable dependencies and an `app.yaml` command starting the application |
| `tools add mcp`, `uc-function`, `genie`, `sandbox` | Load bindings into model definitions and tool execution |
| `sessions bind` | Select the bound checkpointer and supply session/actor identity |
| `memory bind` | Include bound, actor-scoped memory tools in definitions and execution |
| `tracing bind`, `tracing unbind` | Initialize tracing and open a root span from resolved config |
| `endpoint invoke` | An HTTP endpoint; the caller supplies its path and complete request body |

### Project and startup

Use `agent.toml` for framework, tool/store bindings, and tracing. The existing `.agentbricks/project.toml`
file records framework and template provenance; keep it when working with projects that have it.
Metadata alone does not integrate adapters. Install a compatible `databricks-agentbricks[langgraph]`
distribution, supply the real command in `app.yaml`, load configuration before adapters, and listen
on the app port. The Agent Bricks CLI and runtime find `agent.toml` from the working directory or
`AGENTBRICKS_PROJECT_ROOT`. Keep credentials out of `app.yaml`.

Store binding commands declare intent. `dev --workspace-stores` validates existing declared stores
and supplies runtime config using the selected profile; plain `dev` keeps state in-process and
memory off. `deploy` provisions missing declared stores and grants app access. The resolved Memory Store ID reaches the runtime
as `AGENT_MEMORY_STORE`, rather than being stored as an ID in the manifest. Do not hardcode values
that make later bindings ineffective.

### Tools

Use `databricks_agentkit.langgraph.mcp_tools()` for MCP, UC function, and sandbox bindings, combining
them with existing servers without duplicates. It applies sandbox downscoping. Local Python tools
belong in source; the template discovers `BaseTool` objects through
[agent/tools/__init__.py](agent/tools/__init__.py).

Feed selected tools into both model definitions and graph execution while preserving approval
policy. New bindings must become effective on the next graph construction or restart without
another source edit.

### Sessions and memory

Use `checkpointer()` for managed state and merge `thread_config(session_id, actor)` into every
graph run. The helper selects the bound Session Store or an in-process saver; explicit arguments
and environment overrides take precedence. It caches the saver per process, so restart after a
binding change. The application state must be serializable by the selected saver.

Include `memory_tools(actor)` in model and execution wiring. It returns no tools when unconfigured.
Its closures capture actor identity, so never reuse them across users. The application owns trusted
actor/tenant authentication; a payload field alone does not establish identity.

### Tracing

Call `configure_tracing()` after loading config, then wrap agent execution, including streams, in
`start_trace(..., session_id=session_id)`. The root span lets framework autologging record children.
The helper enables tracing when destination and experiment settings are present and disables it
otherwise. Preserve existing tracing semantics when composing it.

## Managed server adapter

For the managed invocation protocol, construct `DurableAgentServer` in [runtime/main.py](runtime/main.py)
and register [runtime/adapter.py](runtime/adapter.py) hooks. Keep framework-native execution in
[agent/agent.py](agent/agent.py), independent of runtime request/context types.

The invoke hook translates opaque application input, runs the graph, translates native events,
calls `await context.emit(event)`, and returns JSON output. DurableAgentServer owns foreground/background
transport, polling, and replay. Invocation UUIDs differ from stable application session IDs; the
`X-Routing-Key` sticky-routing header is not the application session. `DurableAgentServer` accepts
the application session as an optional top-level `session_id`; this template requires it for graph
conversation state. The adapter reads it only from `InvocationContext` and does not echo it in the
agent response; clients retain the value they submitted. `X-Routing-Key` is routing only and is
never used as the session ID. The header is non-blank, no more than 128 UTF-8 bytes, used verbatim,
and takes precedence over the legacy `__Host-databricks-app-router` cookie (for routing).

The example assumes `messages` state and message/update events. Custom state, outputs, and
interrupts require explicit mappings and must not be discarded to fit the example.

### Recovery and durability

Runtime Store persistence covers invocations and emitted events. Session Store persistence covers
graph checkpoints and paused interrupts. A durable Runtime Store alone does not preserve graph
state. `dev` uses process-local invocation storage; deployment attaches a Lakebase-backed
Runtime Store.

Register recovery when intended. Resume a checkpoint only when metadata associates it with the
current invocation; otherwise replay original input. Use synchronous checkpoint durability before
acknowledging progress. Recovery is at least once, so side effects must tolerate replay.

Recovery uses `databricks_agentkit.langgraph.responses.checkpointed_messages` to restore this
invocation's committed outputs, then resumes the same graph. Saved messages seed the response
without being emitted again. Keep checkpoint history and task writes available during recovery.
Checkpoint and Runtime Store event writes are not atomic.

## Optional chat app

No CLI command requires the chat UI. The default overlay supplies it; `--disable-chat-app` omits
it. When adopting it, inspect `CHAT_APP.md`, `runtime/ui.py`, and browser code. Adapt model choice,
history, interrupts, and authentication to the actual graph. Its message-oriented assumptions must
not silently change custom application behavior.
